# Brute-Force-Password-Cracker
Final project for algorithms is a brute force password cracker

This project is a John the Ripper like password cracker written by David Chidester, Elijah Crockett, and Patric Charlton 
as a final project for CS-343 Analysis of Algorithms at Willammett University.
It can either use brute force string generation to crack passwords or take input from a wordlist (i.e. rockyou wordlist).
